# Module 1 Challenge: Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview

In this challenge, I built on the skills I learned throughout the module lessons by creating tables and then pulling data from those tables to further visualize the outcomes of the date through a line graph and a pivot chart.

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to help Louise visualize how the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges:

To analyze campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals I used the following visualizations, skills and functions:

·      Pivot table and line graph visualizations

·      Creating new columns of information by using extracting, filtering and sorting skills to pull data from other columns and sheets

·      Creating new sheets and inputting new data

·      Using functions such as ```YEAR()```, ```COUNTIFS()```, and ```SUM()```

The challenges I encountered were my own fault caused by me not following the very clear instructions that were provided.  I struggled with building the pivot table because I forgot how you could manipulate the fields.  I never could figure out where I made an error in my Kickstarter sheet so I could make my line graph match the example.  I also struggled with using the ```COUNTIF()``` function because I was using ```COUNTIF()``` instead of ```COUNTIFS()```.  I overcame all of these challenges (except the line graph issue) by staying patient with myself and rereading the instructions.  I definitely started out, in my head, making this harder than it really was.  I have always believed, and teach my staff, that you learn best through your mistakes so I just allowed myself the time to make the mistakes until I figured it out.  I really enjoyed the process even if I wanted to bang my head on my desk a few times.

## Results:

·      Two conclusions I can draw about the Theatres Outcomes by Launch Date are that were more considerably more successful outcomes than failed or canceled and despite my numbers being off in each month, the totals all match.

·      In the Outcomes Based on Goals data, I would conclude that the number of outcomes that were successful were pretty evenly matched with the number that failed.

·      The limitations of this dataset would be in the person pulling the data and also that it doesn’t include which plays were most successful, failed or canceled so that plans can be made for the next year to possibly exclude them.

·      I would include a table that also filtered the names of the plays with the successful, failed or canceled outcomes and a bar graph for visualization.
